# JS-Basics
Here we have some basic yet interesting projects of JavaScript.

JS_Ques6 : Create a form that takes data about a pet. The form must be well designed and should accept
the petâ€™s name, age, weight, type, and what it likes most. At the submission of this form create
a Pet object in JavaScript filled with these values and log that object and equivalent JSON on
the console.
