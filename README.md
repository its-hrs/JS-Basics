# JS-Basics
Here we have some basic yet interesting projects of JavaScript.

JS_Prac1: Write JavaScript code to find sum of series 1/2+3/4+5/6+7/8+…..
Take input for number of terms in series in an input textbox. (e.g. - number of terms in the example above is 4).
Also write validation script to check whether the input field is not blank and that only numeric values are entered.

JS_Ques4: Create an HTML page with the sole purpose to show multiplication tables of 2 to 10 (row-wise)
created by JavaScript. Initially, the page is blank. With help of setInterval function print a row
every 5 seconds in different colors and increasing font size.

JS_Ques5: Create an HTML page with a paragraph written on it and under which 9 buttons are placed in a
3X3 grid. The first row is for buttons labeled with colors names Red, Green, and Blue, the
second row with numbers 10, 20, 30, and the third row with different font names. Click event
of each of the buttons should make the appropriate change in the style of paragraph.

JS_Ques6 : Create a form that takes data about a pet. The form must be well designed and should accept
the pet’s name, age, weight, type, and what it likes most. At the submission of this form create
a Pet object in JavaScript filled with these values and log that object and equivalent JSON on
the console.
